`dbeta` function gives the density of beta distribution
```{r}
x= seq(0,1,0.01)
curve(dbeta(x, 3, 19),0,1)
```
Try informative prior.

When we are fairly certain that between 5% and 40% of households would be interested.

With some tiral and error, you find that a Beta(1.5, 6) distribution gives roughly 80% probabilty to the range (0.05,4)

```{r}
pbeta(c(0.05,0.4), 1.5, 6)
curve(dbeta(x,1.5,6), 0, 1)
abline(v=c(0.05, 0.4), lty=2)
```

```{r}
curve(dbeta(x, 3.5,24), 0, 1) # posterior (informative prior)
curve(dbeta(x,1.5,6), 0,1, add=TRUE, lty=2) # informative prior
curve(dbeta(x,3,19), 0,1, add=TRUE, col="blue") # posterior(flat prior)
curve(dbeta(x,1,1), 0, 1, add=TRUE, col="blue" , lty=2) # flat

```
